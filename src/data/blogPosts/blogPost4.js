    <p>Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a design pattern where components communicate through events rather than direct calls. This approach provides better scalability, loose coupling, and resilience in distributed systems.</p>
    
    <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
    
    <h3>Events</h3>
    <p>Events represent something that happened in the system:</p>
    
    <pre><code>{
  "eventId": "evt_123",
  "eventType": "UserRegistered",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "userId": "user_456",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "registrationDate": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"
  }
}</code></pre>
    
    <h3>Event Producers</h3>
    <p>Components that generate events when state changes occur.</p>
    
    <h3>Event Consumers</h3>
    <p>Components that react to events and perform actions based on them.</p>
    
    <h2>Event-Driven Patterns</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Event Notification</h3>
    <p>Simple notification pattern where events inform other services:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Order service publishes "OrderCreated" event</li>
      <li>Inventory service consumes event to update stock</li>
      <li>Email service sends confirmation email</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2. Event Sourcing</h3>
    <p>Store events as the source of truth:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>All state changes are stored as events</li>
      <li>Current state is derived by replaying events</li>
      <li>Provides complete audit trail</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3. CQRS with Events</h3>
    <p>Commands generate events, queries read from materialized views:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Write side processes commands and publishes events</li>
      <li>Read side subscribes to events to update views</li>
      <li>Enables independent scaling of read and write</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Event Streaming Platforms</h2>
    
    <h3>Apache Kafka</h3>
    <p>Distributed streaming platform with high throughput:</p>
    
    <pre><code>// Producer
const producer = kafka.producer();
await producer.send({
  topic: 'user-events',
  messages: [{
    key: userId,
    value: JSON.stringify(event)
  }]
});

// Consumer
const consumer = kafka.consumer({ groupId: 'email-service' });
await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'user-events' });
await consumer.run({
  eachMessage: async ({ message }) => {
    const event = JSON.parse(message.value.toString());
    await sendWelcomeEmail(event.data);
  }
});</code></pre>
    
    <h3>Amazon EventBridge</h3>
    <p>Serverless event bus for AWS services:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Easy integration with AWS services</li>
      <li>Built-in filtering and routing</li>
      <li>Pay-per-use pricing model</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Benefits of Event-Driven Architecture</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Loose Coupling:</strong> Services don't need to know about each other</li>
      <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Easy to add new consumers</li>
      <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Failures don't cascade between services</li>
      <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Easy to change business logic</li>
      <li><strong>Auditability:</strong> Complete event history</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Challenges and Considerations</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Eventual Consistency:</strong> Systems may be temporarily inconsistent</li>
      <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> Tracing requests across services is complex</li>
      <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Integration testing becomes more complex</li>
      <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Need comprehensive event monitoring</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Design events to be immutable and versioned</li>
      <li>Use idempotent consumers to handle duplicate events</li>
      <li>Implement proper error handling and dead letter queues</li>
      <li>Monitor event processing latency and throughput</li>
      <li>Document event schemas and contracts</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Event-driven architecture is powerful for building scalable, resilient systems. However, it requires careful design and consideration of consistency requirements and operational complexity.</p>
