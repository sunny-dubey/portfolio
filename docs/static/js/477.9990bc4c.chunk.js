No Medium-style tips and tricks shall be provided from my end. All you need to know is that it has three modes: Agent mode, Plan (or Planning) mode, and Ask mode.</p>\n\n    <p>So how do you use cursor to its full potential? Start with Ask Mode to understand the issue and get some clarity. Once you understood the problem, switch to Plan Mode to map out how to solve it based on insights from Ask Mode. Finally, let Agent Mode do the heavy lifting. That\u2019s it. It works for me, and it\u2019ll work for you too.</p>\n\n    <p>This AI-wrapper tool actually delivers real value. I know people who are willing to pay for it out of their own pocket if their company doesn\u2019t provide the organization plan. That\u2019s how good it is.</p>\n    \n    <p>I\'ve never cared to follow software updates as closely as I do with cursor. Rumor on twitter says they\'re about to launch version 2.0.</p>\n\n    <p>Highly recommended! </p>\n  '}]}}]);
